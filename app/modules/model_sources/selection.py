"""Shared model-source selection helpers.

Both the HTTP request handlers and the WebSocket session path need to decide
whether a requested model is served by an OpenAI-compatible model source.
Keeping that decision in one module stops the two transports from drifting
apart: previously only the HTTP handlers consulted model sources, so a
source-owned model requested over WebSocket fell through to subscription
account selection and was rejected upstream.

    """True when WebSocket must not hand ``model`` to a subscription account.

    Used by the WebSocket path, which cannot forward to a model source and must
    fail the session so the client falls back to the HTTP transport.

    Disabled-source ownership counts as ownership here: the WebSocket transport
    cannot serve a source-owned model regardless of the source's enabled state,
    and dispatching the turn to a subscription account instead produces the
    opaque upstream 400 (``The '<model>' model is not supported when using
    Codex with a ChatGPT account.``). Bouncing the turn to HTTP lands it on the
    disabled-source denial there, which answers 503 ``model_source_disabled``
    and names the actual condition. The second, ``only_disabled`` probe runs
    only after the ordinary lookup misses, so enabled sources keep resolving in
    a single query.

    The API key's ``enforced_model`` is considered alongside the requested
    model, matching how the HTTP handlers build their candidate list: an
    enforced model that resolves to a source must not slip through to
    subscription-account selection.

    ``raw_model`` is the client's requested model captured before request
    preparation normalized aliases (``gpt-5-high`` -> ``gpt-5``), mirroring the
    HTTP path's ``raw_source_model``: the caller has already substituted the
    API key's ``enforced_model`` and applied the fast-mode correction, so it is
    used verbatim as the leading source candidate. When omitted (request states
    that predate preparation, e.g. replayed turns), the raw candidate is
    derived from ``enforced_model``/``model`` as before.

    Resolution failures fail open to ``False``. This helper only gates the
    WebSocket transport, where the alternative is worse: the lookup runs after
    the turn's usage reservation is acquired but before it is registered for
    cleanup, so a propagating database error tears the whole session down and
    strands the reservation until the stale reaper runs. Failing open degrades
    to the pre-guard behaviour (the subscription upstream rejects the model),
    and source forwarding could not have worked anyway — it needs the same
    database for the source's credentials. The HTTP handlers deliberately do
    not use this helper: they call ``select_responses_model_source`` directly
    and must keep surfacing resolution errors rather than silently routing
    source traffic to a subscription account.

    A source-scoped key whose durable assignment set became empty is also a
    source boundary even though no surviving source row can prove ownership.
    The HTTP path already fails that state closed via
    ``source_scoped_model_requires_source``; include the same predicate here so
    WebSocket cannot broaden the key back onto subscription routing after its
    final assigned source is deleted.
